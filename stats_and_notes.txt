each 'scene' has 4 images in multiple bands and pixel sizes

Each scene has a unique Xmax and Ymin. Within each scene, each image will have its own transformation for the class polygons (using Xmax, yMin, and the images x and y pixel count). The polygons must be transformed 4 times, once for each image type within a scene. When making classifications, the transformations have to be done in reverse to get them back to the original scale for submission.



goal:

- look at frequency and area distribution of classes
- determine top 3 classes in order of area and score importance
	- crops
	- trees 
	- buildings

image ID of top 3 occurances for 3 highest classes:
	- crops
		- 6060_2_3 94%
		- 6150_2_3 80%
		- 6110_4_0 80%
	- trees
		- 6170_0_4 30%
		- 6010_4_4 29%
		- 6170_4_1 26%
	- buildings
		- 6120_2_2 26%
		- 6110_1_2 16%
		- 6140_1_2 15%

image ID of low (or zero) occurance for 3 highest classes:
	- crops
		- 6010_4_2 0%
	- trees
		- 6140_1_2 3.5%
	- buildings
		- 6010_1_2 0%


some stats:







for each class I want to know it's level of distribution across each training image, this will be helpful for training on specific images


for each class I want to know it's total mask sum accross all training images
